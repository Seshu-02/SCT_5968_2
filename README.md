Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization
This project uses Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis and visualizations on the Titanic dataset. The data is loaded from a ZIP archive containing the train.csv file, and several insightful charts are generated to understand survival patterns among Titanic passengers.

Overview
The project workflow includes:

Loading data directly from a ZIP file

Basic data cleaning (handling missing values in the Age and Embarked columns)

Generating visual representations for survival counts, distributions, and relationships

Visualizations
The following analyses are performed:

Survival Count

A simple bar plot showing the total number of passengers who survived and did not survive.

Survival by Gender

Comparative bar plot to examine survival rates split by gender.

Survival by Passenger Class

Comparative bar plot illustrating survival statistics according to passenger ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

Age Distribution by Survival

Kernel density estimate plot comparing age distributions for survivors and non-survivors.

Survival by Embarkation Point

Bar plot showing survival counts by port of embarkation (C, Q, or S).
